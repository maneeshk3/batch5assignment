        // Call the fuelTypeInfo() method using the Vehicle reference to display the fuelType.
        // Try to call the playMusic() method using the Vehicle reference. This should result in a compilation error (as Vehicle doesnâ€™t define playMusic()).
        // Use casting to convert the Vehicle reference back to a Car object and then successfully call the playMusic() method.
    
	
    // Demonstrate Polymorphism with Both Subclasses:
        // Create a Vehicle reference for both a Car and a Motorcycle.
        // Call the startEngine() method using both references to demonstrate polymorphism.

		// even though the reference is of type Vehicle.
    
    // Polymorphism and Method Resolution:
        // Show that method overriding (for startEngine()) works through the superclass reference, but 
		// subclass-specific methods (like playMusic()) require casting back to the subclass type.
