/*Question 3:
    Create a superclass Vehicle with:
        A String instance variable as brand.
        Create a protected instance variable fuelType of type String.
        A constructor that initializes the brand and the fuelType.
        Implement a method fuelTypeInfo() that prints the fuelType of the vehicle.
        A method startEngine() that prints: Starting the vehicle's engine....
    
    Then create a subclass Car that inherits from Vehicle with:
        An additional int instance variable yearOfLaunch.
        A constructor that initializes brand, fuelType and yearOfLaunch using the super keyword.
        Override the startEngine() method to print: Starting the car's engine...
        Add a method playMusic() that prints Playing music in the car...
        
    In the main() method:
        Declare a reference variable of type Vehicle and assign the reference of a Car object.
        Call the startEngine() method using the Vehicle reference and observe that the method which  is executed.
        Call the fuelTypeInfo() method using the Vehicle reference to display the fuelType.
        Try to call the playMusic() method using the Vehicle reference. This should result in a compilation error (as Vehicle doesnâ€™t define playMusic()).
        Use casting to convert the Vehicle reference back to a Car object and then successfully call the playMusic() method.
    
    Subclass Motorcycle (inherits from Vehicle):
        Create a constructor that initializes the fuelType of the Motorcycle.
        Override the startEngine() method to print Starting the motorcycle's engine...
        
    Demonstrate Polymorphism with Both Subclasses:
        Create a Vehicle reference for both a Car and a Motorcycle.
        Call the startEngine() method using both references to demonstrate polymorphism.
        Show that the correct startEngine() method is invoked for each subclass (Car and Motorcycle), even though the reference is of type Vehicle.
    
    Polymorphism and Method Resolution:
        Show that method overriding (for startEngine()) works through the superclass reference, but subclass-specific methods (like playMusic()) require casting back to the subclass type.
