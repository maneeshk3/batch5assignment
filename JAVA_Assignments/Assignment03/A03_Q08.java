Question 8:
write a java class StaticBlock, Create a static block in the class which has some instance 
variables, and also some instance variables out of the static block.
Try to update the values of all the instane variable from a object, and check the values from the 
object of the same class.
Also update the values of the static block instance variable and non static instance variable from one 
object and check the values from the other object. Note down your observation.
