// Question 3:
    // Create a superclass Vehicle with:
        // A String instance variable as brand.
        // Create a protected instance variable fuelType of type String.
        // A constructor that initializes the brand and the fuelType.
        // Implement a method fuelTypeInfo() that prints the fuelType of the vehicle.
        // A method startEngine() that prints: Starting the vehicle's engine....
    
    // Then create a subclass Car that inherits from Vehicle with:
        // An additional int instance variable yearOfLaunch.
        // A constructor that initializes brand, fuelType and yearOfLaunch using the super keyword.
        // Override the startEngine() method to print: Starting the car's engine...
        // Add a method playMusic() that prints Playing music in the car...
        
    // In the main() method:
        // Declare a reference variable of type Vehicle and assign the reference of a Car object.
        // Call the startEngine() method using the Vehicle reference and observe that the method which  is executed.
        // Call the fuelTypeInfo() method using the Vehicle reference to display the fuelType.
        // Try to call the playMusic() method using the Vehicle reference. This should result in a compilation error (as Vehicle doesnâ€™t define playMusic()).
        // Use casting to convert the Vehicle reference back to a Car object and then successfully call the playMusic() method.
    
    // Subclass Motorcycle (inherits from Vehicle):
        // Create a constructor that initializes the fuelType of the Motorcycle.
        // Override the startEngine() method to print Starting the motorcycle's engine...
        
    // Demonstrate Polymorphism with Both Subclasses:
        // Create a Vehicle reference for both a Car and a Motorcycle.
        // Call the startEngine() method using both references to demonstrate polymorphism.
        // Show that the correct startEngine() method is invoked for each subclass (Car and Motorcycle), even though the reference is of type Vehicle.
    
    // Polymorphism and Method Resolution:
        // Show that method overriding (for startEngine()) works through the superclass reference, but subclass-specific methods (like playMusic()) require casting back to the subclass type.
